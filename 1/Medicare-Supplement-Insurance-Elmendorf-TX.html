<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

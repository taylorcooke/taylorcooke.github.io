<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year when you don’t need to.

You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

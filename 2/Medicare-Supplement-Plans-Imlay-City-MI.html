<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 yearly but after all -- for these plans -- the premium is higher. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is usually reported.<p>

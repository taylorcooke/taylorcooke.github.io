<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare solely in the course of the Medicare common enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based mostly on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and might enroll later throughout a SEP. For instance, employer coverage for retirees or through COBRA doesn’t depend as present employment, so these individuals don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>

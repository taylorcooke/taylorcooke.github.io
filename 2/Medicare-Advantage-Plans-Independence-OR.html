<p>Third, people who stay in two completely different geographical areas of the country at totally different occasions of the 12 months (principally so-known as snowbirds) discover it difficult to live with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C threat adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), however it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans might cover benefits differently. For instance, plans that require higher out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, such as expert nursing facility care, may offer decrease copayments for physician visits to balance their benefits bundle.<p>

Work with your major care provider and your family to decide on a plan that you can afford and that has the coverages you’ll use probably the most. Advantage plans restrict what you'll be able to pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>

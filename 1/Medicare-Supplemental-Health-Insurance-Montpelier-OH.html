<p> Medicare Advantage plans are a substitute for Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurance corporations and canopy the same health care providers as Original Medicare.

<p>Prior to 2021, patients with end-stage renal illness were unable to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans until there was a Medicare Special Needs plan obtainable in their space for ESRD patients. But that's changing for 2021, under the terms of the 21st Century Cures Act.<p>

These plans are known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>
<p>Medicare Advantage plans often incorporate extra benefits, including Part D coverage and extras such as dental and vision. And the plans do include a cap on out-of-pocket prices that can’t exceed $6,seven-hundred in 2020 , which Original Medicare doesn't have. But Advantage plans are inclined to constrain beneficiaries to a limited provider network, and coverage for specific providers will not be as strong as it will be with Original Medicare plus supplemental coverage.

You’ll have a six-month assured-problem window during which you'll be able to join any Medigap plan available in your space. In most states and most circumstances, you’ll need to go through medical underwriting should you determine to use for a Medigap plan after that window ends.

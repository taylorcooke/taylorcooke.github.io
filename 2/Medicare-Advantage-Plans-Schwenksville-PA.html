Krugman cites all of the familiar figures from the rest of the developed world, where some mixture of public insurance with some private parts manages to cover virtually everyone and at a much decrease cost than within the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the desk on this country by the private corporate interests who profit from the expensive mess of a health care system we have now. Meant to add to my downside proven above — a Social Security employee told me that to keep away from starting Medicare on my 65th birthday, no matter once I apply, I would have had to make the request six months BEFORE my sixty fifth birthday.<p>

<p>Medicare Advantage, also called Medicare Part C, is health coverage provided by private insurance corporations. Medicare Advantage plans supply the same benefits as Original Medicare and sometimes includes additional coverage corresponding to prescription drugs, dental, vision, and hearing.

<h3>Medicare Supplemental Health Insurance Jonesville Virginia 24263</h3>

<p>Most Americans start accumulating social security as quickly as they will.

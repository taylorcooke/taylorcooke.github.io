You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>If you do not have Medicare otherwise you want to enroll in Part A , contactSocial Security. Your plan leaves the Medicare program in the midst of the 12 months.

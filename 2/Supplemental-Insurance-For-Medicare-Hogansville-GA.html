<p>However, home partners (identical-gender and reverse-gender) are normally not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are suggested to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age sixty five to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether or not late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred.

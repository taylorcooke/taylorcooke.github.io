That stated, it often pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even when you have health coverage already. It won’t cost you anything, and this way, Medicare can serve as your secondary insurance and potentially pick up the tab for something your main insurance doesn’t cover. If you do not sign up for Part B if you're first eligible, you might have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>

<p>Yes, these may be complicated calculations, but an insurance dealer might help by doing the math for you and making cost-saving recommendations. Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance firms or via brokers, but not onmedicare.gov.<p>
<p>Medicare Part A offers FFS funds for admitted in-patient hospital care, hospice, and skilled nursing services if an individual is first admitted inpatient for 3 days. Less usually, hearing and wellness benefits not present in Medicare Part B are included in a Medicare Advantage or different Part C plan.

<p>Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage also handle funds to healthcare providers in a different way.

<p>If you are not signing up for Medicare at sixty five and presently have firm provided group coverage, are you required to confirm this with Medicare?

How do they confirm whether or not you could have or didn’t have a group health plan?<p>
<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare solely through the Medicare basic enrollment period . Generally, if a person remains to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based mostly on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and may enroll later throughout a SEP. For instance, employer coverage for retirees or by way of COBRA doesn’t count as current employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
<p>If you are eligible for premium-free Part A and you don’t enroll in Part A and B before your 65th birthday, you can lose your UC-sponsored medical coverage and be charged penalties by RASC and lifelong penalties by Medicare.

Sending within the information by this date permits for the well timed processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan. Ninety days earlier than your sixty fifth birthday, RASC will send you a letter with information about enrolling in Medicare. Remember, you and/or your spouse can maintain off on enrolling in Medicare as long as you’re working — just make sure to enroll whenever you retire.<p>

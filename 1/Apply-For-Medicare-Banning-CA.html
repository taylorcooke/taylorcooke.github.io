<p>Yes, you possibly can enroll in Medicare at sixty five and stop paying premiums for your present insurance. The six months of retroactive coverage applies when you join Medicare after age sixty five. At that time, whenever you enroll, your coverage dates again to either six months, or your 65th birthday — whichever is shorter. It doesn’t matter if your employer has 20 full-time or half-time staff; the threshold is 20 to be thought of a group health plan for Medicare special enrollment purposes.<p>
<p> Medicare Advantage plans are an alternative to Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans are provided by private insurance firms and cover the same health care providers as Original Medicare. There’s generally no distinction in coverage between a free plan and a paid plan. Regardless of cost, most Medicare Part C plans supply components A and B, prescription drug, and different extra coverage.<p>

<p>Replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare prescription drug plan. Switch to a different Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. Enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you qualify, you'll be able to return to Original Medicare (Parts A & B) or be part of, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Prescription Drug plan.

Only give your Medicare Number to doctors, pharmacists, other health care providers, your insurers, or folks you belief to work with Medicare in your behalf. If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your primary card for Medicare—you need to nonetheless keep and use it everytime you want care. And, when you have a Medicare drug plan, make sure to hold that card as nicely.<p>

Generally, if a person is still working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based mostly on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and may enroll later during a SEP.

Medicare Part A usually doesn’t cover the complete amount of your hospital bill, so you'll in all probability be answerable for a share in the fee.

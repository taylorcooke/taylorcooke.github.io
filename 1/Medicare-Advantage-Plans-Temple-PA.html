Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the year, which might lead to penalties.

That stated, you should qualify for Special Enrollment into Part B when you do decide to delay enrollment.<p>
<p>Medicare is a national medical health insurance program that covers millions of individuals and entails a fair higher number of healthcare providers and companies. If you have missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment interval, there is a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 yearly. During this other Medicare Open Enrollment interval, you'll be able to change from one Medicare Advantage plan to another, and you could return to Original Medicare.

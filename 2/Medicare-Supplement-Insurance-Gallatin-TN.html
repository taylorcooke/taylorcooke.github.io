If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Though you don’t need to enroll in Medicare at age sixty five when you have coverage by way of a certified group health plan, doing so may make sense if that plan isn’t heavily subsidized by your employer.<p>

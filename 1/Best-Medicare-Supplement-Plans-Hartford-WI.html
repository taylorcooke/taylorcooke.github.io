The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period runs from January 1 to March 31. Many beneficiaries are mechanically eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for example, those that have worked or spouses have worked a minimum of 10 years, or 40 quarters, and paid Medicare taxes through their employment. You’ll in all probability need to enroll in Medicare whenever you first turn out to be eligible — for instance, when you’re approaching your sixty fifth birthday.<p>

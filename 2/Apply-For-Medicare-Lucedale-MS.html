<p>As a common rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage by way of them since the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B.

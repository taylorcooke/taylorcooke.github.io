<p>But these averages mask broad regional and helpful variations. Just as crucial good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the major determinant of monthly premium differences is the dimensions of that protection. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary can't spend greater than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical companies; it is plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums.

<p>The general enrollment period for Original Medicare is from January 1 by way of March 31 of each year. Keep in thoughts that you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B when you did not enroll whenever you had been first eligible. If you've health coverage by way of current employment (either via your work or your partner’s employer), you could resolve to delay Medicare Part B enrollment.

The Part C danger adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), however it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans might cover benefits another way. For example, plans that require greater out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, similar to expert nursing facility care, might offer decrease copayments for physician visits to stability their benefits bundle.<p>

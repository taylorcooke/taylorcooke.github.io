<h3>Health Insurance in Lewiston: The Race Against the Clock</h3>

You could then should pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B because you may have had Part B and didn't enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a ten% higher premium for every 12-month period that you just have been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it.

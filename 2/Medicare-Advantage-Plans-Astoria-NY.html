<p>I would counsel addressing that problem with a union representative and going from there. Some individuals choose to pay for health coverage by way of an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a choice then that’s something to first handle with the entity that’s forcing you to acquire Medicare.<p>

In most instances, it is dependent upon whether you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>

Higher-earnings beneficiaries, although, have paid extra for premiums since 2007 through month-to-month surcharges. About 7% of Medicare's 61 million or so beneficiaries pays extra due to these earnings-adjusted amounts .<p>

<p>When you file on your own retirement benefit, you'll receive an additional fee roughly equal to the amount by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit.

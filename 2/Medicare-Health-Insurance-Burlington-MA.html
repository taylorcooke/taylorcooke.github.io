Compare these costs to those of purchasing Medigap and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies. Calculate the premiums, in addition to the quantity of any out-of-pocket bills (deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance) the insurance policies could require.<p>
<p>Most Medigap plans also cover no less than a portion of expert nursing facility coinsurance costs.

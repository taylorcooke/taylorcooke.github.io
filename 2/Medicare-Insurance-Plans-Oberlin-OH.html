Funds obtained from Medicare are deposited into the savings account and could be withdrawn tax free to pay for qualified health care bills. Part C sponsors yearly submit bids that permit them to take part in the program.<p>
<p>But should you enrolled in Medicare despite having health coverage, it leads me to imagine that your employer coverage left some gaps, which is why you chose Medicare. Either means, you've the choice to stop Medicare and sign up again if you want it. My husband is eligible for medicare in March but continues to be working full time and will continue to do so till he is 70.

<p>You can delay your Part B efficient date up to three months when you enroll when you nonetheless have employer-sponsored coverage or within one month after that coverage ends. Otherwise, your Part B coverage will start the month after you enroll. The Part B SEP permits beneficiaries to delay enrollment if they've health coverage via their own or a spouse’s present employer.<p>

You are taking a risk delaying Part B as a result of as soon as he retires Medicare is his major insurance, whatever the variety of staff at his firm and whether you’re really enrolled.<p>

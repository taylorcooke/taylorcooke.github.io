If you signed up for Medicare through Social Security, then you'll need to contact them to drop Part B coverage. If your Medicare coverage has began and also you need to drop Part B, contact Social Security for instructions on the way to submit a signed request. Your coverage will end the first day of the month after Social Security will get your request. If you're under sixty five and receiving sure disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you will be routinely enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, after 24 months of disability benefits.<p>

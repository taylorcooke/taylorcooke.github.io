When very small employers be a part of together with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide major coverage so long as no less than one of many employers has 20+ employees. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check with his group plan to see what their particular guidelines are.

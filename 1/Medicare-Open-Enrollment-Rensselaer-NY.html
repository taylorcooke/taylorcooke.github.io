You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

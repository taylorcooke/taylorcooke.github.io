You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

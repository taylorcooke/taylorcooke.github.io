<p>But these averages mask broad regional and helpful differences. Just as crucial good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the main determinant of month-to-month premium variations is the scale of that protection. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary can not spend greater than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical providers; it is plans with this limit that have the bottom premiums.

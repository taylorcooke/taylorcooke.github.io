<p>Generally you'll be able to enroll in Medicare only during the Medicare common enrollment interval . Generally, if a person continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later during a SEP.

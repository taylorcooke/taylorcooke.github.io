Krugman cites all the familiar figures from the remainder of the developed world, where some mix of public insurance with some private components manages to cover nearly everybody and at a much decrease cost than in the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the desk on this nation by the private company pursuits who profit from the expensive mess of a health care system we now have now.

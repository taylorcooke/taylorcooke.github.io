As of 2019, Medicare Advantage plans have been allowed to cover a broader vary of additional benefits, including issues like house health aides, medical transportation, and the installation of in-residence security devices.

<p>The quantity you pay for Part D deductibles, copayments, and/or coinsurance varies by plan.

About 7% of beneficiaries can pay additional from revenue-related adjustment quantities.<p>

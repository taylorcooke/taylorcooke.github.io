Because you and your spouse enroll in Medicare individually, you could make completely different selections in how you receive your Medicare benefits. As a results of these selections, you may have variations in your Medicare benefits. There are 4 “parts” to the Medicare insurance program, each one providing a sure set of Medicare benefits.<p>

Some recipients won't pay the total $a hundred and forty four.60 normal premium as a result of a "hold innocent" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising more than their Social Security cost-of-residing adjustment, or COLA. The standard month-to-month premium for Medicare Part B might be $144.60 for 2020, up $9.10 from $135.50 in 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced Friday.<p>

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

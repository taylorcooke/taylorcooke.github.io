<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to maintain it once you enroll. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment period that lasts eight months.

Work together with your primary care provider and your family to choose a plan that you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use probably the most. Advantage plans restrict what you possibly can pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>

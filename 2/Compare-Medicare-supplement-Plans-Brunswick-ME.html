<p>Generally you'll be able to enroll in Medicare only in the course of the Medicare basic enrollment period . Generally, if a person is still working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based mostly on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and may enroll later during a SEP.

I’ll be getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board at least 4 months before I turn sixty five. In most cases, it depends on whether you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>

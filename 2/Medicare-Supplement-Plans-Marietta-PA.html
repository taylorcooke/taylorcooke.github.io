<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

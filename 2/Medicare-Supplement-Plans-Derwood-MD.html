<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to keep it once you sign up. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t must enroll in Medicare at age 65 in case you have coverage via a qualified group health plan, doing so may make sense if that plan isn’t heavily sponsored by your employer.<p>

<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare only during the Medicare general enrollment period . Generally, if an individual is still working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later during a SEP. For example, employer coverage for retirees or via COBRA doesn’t depend as current employment, so these individuals don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
<p>You’ll obtain your Medicare card in the mail about three months before you flip 65, and your coverage will take effect the first of the month you flip 65. In order to enroll in Medicare Advantage, you must enroll in both Medicare Part A and Part B.

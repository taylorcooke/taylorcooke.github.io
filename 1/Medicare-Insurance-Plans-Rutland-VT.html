<p>Plan prices are sometimes decrease than those of different Medicare Advantage plan types, but you’re normally limited to docs in the plan’s provider community. Medicare Advantage plans may provide extra (“supplemental”) benefits that are not provided in traditional Medicare, and can use rebate dollars to assist cover the price of extra benefits. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans have been in a position to provide further supplemental benefits that weren't offered in previous years.

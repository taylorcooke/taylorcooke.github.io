<p>Plan prices are typically lower than those of other Medicare Advantage plan varieties, however you’re normally restricted to docs in the plan’s provider community. Medicare Advantage plans might provide further (“supplemental”) benefits that are not supplied in conventional Medicare, and may use rebate dollars to help cover the cost of additional benefits. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans have been able to offer additional supplemental benefits that weren't offered in earlier years.

<p>As a general rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five must confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not.

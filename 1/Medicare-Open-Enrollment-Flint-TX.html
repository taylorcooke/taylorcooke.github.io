<p>As a basic rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five have to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage through them since the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union legal guidelines mandating that you just join Medicare at a given time.<p>

<p>Yes, as long as the plan is out there to all staff to get to that 20. If your employer is unable to complete Section B, please complete that portion as best as you possibly can on behalf of your employer without your employer’s signature.

You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

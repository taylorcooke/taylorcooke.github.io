<p>The general enrollment period for Original Medicare is from January 1 via March 31 of each yr. Keep in mind that you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B when you didn't enroll whenever you had been first eligible. If you could have health coverage through present employment (both via your work or your spouse’s employer), you could resolve to delay Medicare Part B enrollment. You should converse with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you simply understand how your present coverage works with Medicare and what the implications could be when you drop Medicare Part B.<p>
<p>When you start Part B, it triggers a special election period that lets you make changes to your coverage outside of the standard enrollment durations.

You can sign up for Medicare Part B at any time that you've got coverage by way of current or active employment.

If you get COBRA or retiree benefits after you stop working, remember that this doesn’t count as coverage primarily based on present employment; ensure you don’t wait until your COBRA benefits finish to enroll in Medicare Part B.<p>

<h3>Tips for Choosing the Right Health Insurance Plan in Glen Rock</h3>
<p>If you choose COBRA after you cease working, do not wait till your COBRA coverage ends to join Medicare. If you delay enrolling in Medicare Part A and/or Part B after your Special Enrollment Period ends, you’ll have to wait until the following General Enrollment Period to enroll, and you could have to pay a late-enrollment penalty.

<p>Advantage plans provide extra coverage like hearing companies, prescription drug coverage, dental companies, and vision care. Medicare Advantage plans would possibly prevent cash, however remember to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll want to buy a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage.

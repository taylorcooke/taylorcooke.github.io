<p>Medicare pays greater charges for sicker patients that are more likely to require more pricey medical providers and less for healthy people.

<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether or not and how it will pay if they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B. Determining whether or not a person qualifies for a Special Enrollment Period is the first important factor to consider when making a call about Part B enrollment. People who are eligible for Medicare primarily based on disability may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period based mostly on their or their partner’s present employment. They could also be eligible primarily based on a spouse or member of the family’s current employment if the employer has one hundred or extra staff.<p>
<p>Your Medicare coverage will begin on the primary day of the month that you flip 65 should you apply at the start of the initial enrollment interval.

<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare only through the Medicare common enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual remains to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later throughout a SEP. For instance, employer coverage for retirees or via COBRA doesn’t count as present employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>

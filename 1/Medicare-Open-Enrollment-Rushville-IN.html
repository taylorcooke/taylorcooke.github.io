<p>The solely exception is if you’re contributing to a health savings account and want to continue doing so. Medicare enrollees aren't allowed to contribute to an HSA, even when they continue to have coverage underneath an employer’s HSA-qualified high-deductible health plan. That stated, it often pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even in case you have health coverage already. It received’t cost you something, and this fashion, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and potentially choose up the tab for anything your primary insurance doesn’t cover. If you do not sign up for Part B whenever you're first eligible, you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>If you enroll through the general enrollment period, your coverage will take effect July 1. If you didn’t enroll in Medicare whenever you were first eligible, you cannot use the autumn open enrollment interval to enroll.<p>

If you’re approaching retirement, likelihood is you’ve already obtained a monetary plan mapped out that will help you smoothly transition from full-time work to a lifetime of leisure. Unfortunately, even one of the best-laid plans can collapse when circumstances change. For instance, many retired Australians have been compelled to return to work after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 wrought havoc on their retirement savings.<p>

<p>As a retiree this happens whenever you turn sixty five; as a UC employee this occurs whenever you retire and you might be 65 or older. Medicare Part A is usually premium-free, but there is a monthly premium for Part B coverage, paid to the Social Security Administration.<p>
<p>If you qualify, you possibly can return to Original Medicare or be part of, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you select to return to Original Medicare in this qualifying event, you may also apply for a Medicare Supplement plan. There are many forms of qualifying events, including moving into or out of a care facility, or shifting out of your current plan’s service area. Some states may have further open enrollment periods, and there may be other conditions in which your acceptance could also be assured.<p>

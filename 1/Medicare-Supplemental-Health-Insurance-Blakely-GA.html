<p>It pays a certain amount in the direction of the cost of Medicare cardholders receiving medical treatments similar to visiting a health care provider or specialist, going to hospital, shopping for prescription treatment and more. Medigap plans, like Medicare Advantage plans, are supplied by way of private insurance firms, and can be found for purchase through brokers like eHealth Insurance Services, Inc.

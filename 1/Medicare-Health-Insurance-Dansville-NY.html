When very small employers join together with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide main coverage so long as no less than one of many employers has 20+ staff. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the first/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check along with his group plan to see what their specific rules are.

<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

When very small employers be a part of together with other employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide main coverage as long as a minimum of one of the employers has 20+ employees. But employers also can ask for exceptions to the first/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check along with his group plan to see what their specific rules are.

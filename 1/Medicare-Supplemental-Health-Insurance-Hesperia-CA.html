<p> Medicare Advantage plans are a substitute for Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurance companies and cover the same health care services as Original Medicare. There’s typically no difference in coverage between a free plan and a paid plan. Regardless of cost, most Medicare Part C plans supply parts A and B, prescription drug, and other further coverage.<p>

<p>But you’ll still need to pay the federal government a premium for Part B, in addition to the premium you pay for Medicare Advantage (which may be $zero, depending on the plan).

About 7% of Medicare's 61 million or so beneficiaries will pay more because of these revenue-adjusted quantities .<p>
<p>As to how much, that I’m afraid I don’t have the information about in addition to the bottom computation. You’d be best to contact and ask your super fund, monetary adviser or the ATO for information in your specific circumstances.

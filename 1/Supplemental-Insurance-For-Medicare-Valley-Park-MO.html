These plans often also have greater deductibles, so you need to rigorously compare these plans with your revenue before making a decision. Instead of simply responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare software at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and complete estimated costs for people like your self. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might need a $15 copay if you see the doctor.<p>

<p>If you're eligible for premium-free Part A and also you don’t enroll in Part A and B earlier than your 65th birthday, you would lose your UC-sponsored medical coverage and be charged penalties by RASC and lifelong penalties by Medicare.

Sending within the info by this date allows for the timely processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan. Ninety days before your 65th birthday, RASC will ship you a letter with details about enrolling in Medicare. Remember, you and/or your spouse can maintain off on enrolling in Medicare so long as you’re working — simply make sure to enroll when you retire.<p>

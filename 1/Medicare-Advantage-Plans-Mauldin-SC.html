<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<h3>Here Is Why Everyone Needs Health Insurance in Fenton</h3>
<p>Remember that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B during your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to wait till the following General Enrollment Period, which happens from January 1 to March 31 annually. You might then need to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you might have had Part B and did not enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a ten% larger premium for every 12-month period that you just were eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t join it. You could need to pay this greater premium for so long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
<p>If you did not enroll in prescription drug coverage throughout IEP, you can sign up for prescription drug coverage during the Annual Election Period that runs every year from October 15 to December 7. Medicare prescription drug coverage is optionally available and does not happen mechanically. Medicare prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans are available via private insurers.<p>
<p>If you’re covered under a partner’s group health plan at a company with 20 or extra staff, you do not want to enroll in Medicare at 65.

For example, when you enroll at sixty five half, you’ll get Medicare dating back to 65.<p>

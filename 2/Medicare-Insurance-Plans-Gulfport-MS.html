You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 annually but after all -- for these plans -- the premium is higher. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is commonly reported.<p>
<p>Star Ratings are calculated each year and will change from one year to the next. You should be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan.

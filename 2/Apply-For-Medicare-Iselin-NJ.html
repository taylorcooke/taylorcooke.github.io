<p>Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage also deal with funds to healthcare suppliers differently. Under Original Medicare, the Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers with a fee for every service supplied to a beneficiary.

Work together with your main care provider and your family to decide on a plan that you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use essentially the most. Advantage plans limit what you'll be able to pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>

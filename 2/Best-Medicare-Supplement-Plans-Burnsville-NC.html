If you select to have Original Medicare coverage, you should buy a Medicare Supplement Insurance policy from a personal insurance company. Medicare is our nation's medical health insurance program for people age sixty five or older.<p>
<p>Consider plan costs, plan medical doctors, convenience, your life-style and travel plans, your health, and any additional benefits in making your Medicare coverage choices.

Work along with your main care provider and your family to choose a plan that you can afford and that has the coverages you’ll use essentially the most. Advantage plans limit what you can pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>

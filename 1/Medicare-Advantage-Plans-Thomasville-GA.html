PPOs generally let members get care outside the plan's network, but members may should pay more for such care. Some plans require prior authorization for specialist care or procedures, and/or a referral from a major care physician.<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to keep it when you enroll. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t need to enroll in Medicare at age 65 if you have coverage through a certified group health plan, doing so would possibly make sense if that plan isn’t closely sponsored by your employer.<p>

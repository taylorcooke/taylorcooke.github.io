If you drop a Medicare Advantage plan throughout AEP and don't enroll in one other one, you'll mechanically go back to Original Medicare.Remember this would possibly mean you may lose drug coverage if it was included with your plan.<p>
<p>If you're turning sixty five and have employer-based mostly coverage through your individual job, you'll be able to delay signing up.

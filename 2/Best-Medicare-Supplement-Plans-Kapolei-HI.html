<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium for your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage.

Instead of simply responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your space. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare device at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at each premiums and total estimated prices for individuals like yourself. For instance, your Medicare Advantage plan might need a $15 copay if you see the physician.<p>
<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether and the way it can pay if they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B.

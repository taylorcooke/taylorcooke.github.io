Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>If you might be turning 65 and have employer-based mostly coverage by way of your personal job, you can delay signing up. Is the insurance by way of your work, or do you buy it separately/individually? If yes, then you need to think about signing up for Medicare or you would face Part B enrollment penalties, denied claims, or more. I will turn 65 on July 6, 2020 so I will start Medicare on July 1, 2020.

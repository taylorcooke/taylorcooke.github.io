<p>But these averages mask wide regional and useful differences. Just as crucial benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the major determinant of monthly premium differences is the size of that safety. By law, a Part C beneficiary can not spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical companies; it's plans with this restrict that have the lowest premiums.

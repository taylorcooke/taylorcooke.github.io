<p>But these averages mask extensive regional and useful variations. Just as an important good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the most important determinant of monthly premium variations is the dimensions of that safety. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary can not spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical companies; it is plans with this restrict that have the bottom premiums.

<p>Third, people who live in two completely different geographical areas of the country at different instances of the year (largely so-called snowbirds) find it troublesome to live with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C risk adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between kinds of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits another way. For example, plans that require larger out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, such as skilled nursing facility care, may offer decrease copayments for doctor visits to balance their benefits package deal.<p>
<p>Since 2017, the average month-to-month Medicare Advantage premium has decreased by an estimated 34.2 %. This is the lowest that the typical monthly premium for a Medicare Advantage plan has been since 2007.<p>

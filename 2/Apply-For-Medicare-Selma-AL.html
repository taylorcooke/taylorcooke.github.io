<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.

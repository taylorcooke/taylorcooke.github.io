You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to keep it once you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t have to enroll in Medicare at age 65 when you have coverage through a certified group health plan, doing so might make sense if that plan isn’t closely sponsored by your employer.<p>

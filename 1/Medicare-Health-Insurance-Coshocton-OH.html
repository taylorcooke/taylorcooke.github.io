You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

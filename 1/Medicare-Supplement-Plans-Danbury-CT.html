<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Many folks decide to pair authentic Medicare with a supplemental policy — called Medigap — to help cover out-of-pocket prices such as deductibles and coinsurance. You can't, nonetheless, pair a Medigap policy with an Advantage Plan.<p>

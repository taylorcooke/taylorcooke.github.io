The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period runs from January 1 to March 31. Many beneficiaries are automatically eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for instance, those that have worked or spouses have labored at least 10 years, or 40 quarters, and paid Medicare taxes by way of their employment.

<p>You can replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare Prescription Drug plan throughout AEP without penalty.

When very small employers be a part of together with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide main coverage so long as no less than one of the employers has 20+ workers.

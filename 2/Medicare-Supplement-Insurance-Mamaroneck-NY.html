An MA plan must provide enrollees in that plan with coverage of all companies which might be covered by Medicare Parts A and B, plus extra benefits past those lined by Medicare. These plans are generally known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>
<p>Remember, should you don’t join Medicare when you’re first eligible and don’t have other coverage based on present employment, you can need to pay a late-enrollment penalty later when you do enroll.

<h3>Medicare Part C And D Russellville Alabama 35653</h3>
<p>If you are not signing up for Medicare at 65 and currently have firm provided group coverage, are you required to confirm this with Medicare?

<p>You don’t want to sign up should you mechanically get Part A and Part B. You'll getyour red, white, and blue Medicare cardin the mail 3 months before your sixty fifth birthday.

Generally, you’re not forced to keep medical health insurance through a job if you don’t need it.<p>

If you’re already receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board benefits and also you’re a U.S. resident, the federal government routinely enrolls you in each Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B at age 65.<p>

Once the OOP most is reached for an individual underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays one hundred% of medical companies for the rest of the calendar yr. That protection has no lifetime most, one other problem with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage.

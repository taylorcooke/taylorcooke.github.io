<p>However, home companions (identical-gender and opposite-gender) are usually not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B with out incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are suggested to contact Social Security three months before turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether or not late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The guidelines are different for workers and retirees; so to make sure you enroll properly, avoid Medicare premium penalties and understand how Medicare works along with your UC-sponsored medical plan, observe these steps. If you do not make any changes throughout AEP, your present plan will routinely renew the next yr.

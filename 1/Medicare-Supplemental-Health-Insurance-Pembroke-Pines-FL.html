<p>Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage also deal with funds to healthcare suppliers in a different way. Under Original Medicare, the Medicare program reimburses healthcare suppliers with a fee for every service supplied to a beneficiary.

<p>Knowing who pays first is the second necessary issue to consider when making a call about Part B enrollment. late enrollment penalty for Part B, it is going to be removed if you apply for Medicare and enroll in Part B primarily based on ESRD. If you aren’t getting benefits from Social Security at least four months earlier than you turn sixty five, you will need to enroll with Social Security to get Part A and Part B.

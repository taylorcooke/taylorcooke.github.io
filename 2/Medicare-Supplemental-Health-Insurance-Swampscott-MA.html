<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
